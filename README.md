# Bingo
Basic Bingo Creator Set

Change the lines in input.txt for the possible bingo fields. Change the constants at the top to choose how many cards to create. The cards are default named to "card_#.html". This can be changed in the Python script.

Yes, this is very janky but it works. If you want it to be better submit a pull request.
